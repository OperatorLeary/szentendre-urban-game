Original prompt: things I don't like currently is when theme is on dark and I hover over some buttons it's way too white and the button becomes unreadable on PC at least when you press it, maybe it's a no factor on phone but I feel like it could be worth fixing, what do you think?

- 2026-02-20: Investigated dark-theme button contrast issue. Found `.quest-button--ghost` in `src/styles/global.css` uses light text in dark mode, while the shared hover style (`.quest-button--ghost:not(:disabled):hover`) sets a near-white background, causing low contrast.
- Plan: add dark-theme-specific hover/active styles for ghost buttons to keep background dark enough for readability.
- 2026-02-20: Added dark-mode-specific .quest-button--ghost hover and active overrides in src/styles/global.css so interactive states stay dark and text remains readable on desktop.
- 2026-02-20: `npm run build` passed after CSS update. Playwright skill-client verification was unavailable in that specific local environment.
- 2026-02-20: Added phase 12 migration to harden alias moderation against numeric-affix bypasses (e.g. fasz67, 67fasz).
- 2026-02-20: Implemented first-pass text-first navigation mode on quest page with optional map hint toggle (persisted in localStorage). Added HU/EN translations and layout styles.
- 2026-02-20: Added phase 15 schema support for layered station instructions (instruction_brief*, instruction_full*) and connected it to Location entity/repository + quest navigation UI with collapsible detailed text and fallback behavior.
- 2026-02-20: Added Phase 16 SQL seed for 24-station HU instruction content (202602200007_phase16_seed_long_route_hu_instructions.sql) mapped by long route sequence index with missing-sequence reporting.
- 2026-02-20: Implemented QR-entry restart mode for better tourist UX: when entering a station via QR start flow (`?entry=qr`), same-route active runs are safely abandoned and a new run is started from the scanned station sequence.
- 2026-02-20: Added Phase 19 migration (`202602200010_phase19_long_route_qr_entry_param.sql`) to backfill long-route QR payloads with `?entry=qr` for consistent QR-first onboarding.
- 2026-02-20: Implemented route-specific station content model (Phase 20) with new `route_stations` table, backfill + RLS, and repository read-path support with safe fallback to legacy `locations` fields if migration is not yet applied.
- 2026-02-21: Validation run for "make sure everything works and the website builds properly" completed.
- 2026-02-21: `npm run check` passed (lint, typecheck, build). Vite production build completed and PWA assets generated without errors.
- 2026-02-21: Runtime smoke checks passed for both dev (`npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`) and preview (`npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174`) with HTTP 200 and expected HTML title.
- 2026-02-21: Attempted required `develop-web-game` Playwright client run; blocked by local runtime mismatch (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` from `web_game_playwright_client.js`) in that environment.
- TODO: On each local machine that runs smoke/tests, execute `npx playwright install` once to provision browser binaries.
- 2026-02-21: Implemented broad UI/UX pass across app shell, home, quest, and admin.
- 2026-02-21: Added reusable dialog accessibility hook (`useDialogA11y`) and wired it to QR scanner, bug report modal, abandon dialog, and desktop notice (focus trap, Escape close, focus restore, dialog labels, backdrop close).
- 2026-02-21: Improved QR scanner reliability with error throttling and clearer camera guidance/error mapping (permission denied / no camera / insecure context), plus new localized copy.
- 2026-02-21: Improved control semantics and keyboard UX: theme switcher + quest navigation mode now use radio semantics with arrow-key navigation.
- 2026-02-21: Added route-context layout handling to prevent fixed-control overlap on mobile quest screens (`app-shell--quest-route` spacing + FAB offsets).
- 2026-02-21: Home page improvements: route cards now show metadata (station count + estimated minutes), and errors are split by scope (route/alias/scanner) with transient auto-clear for alias/scanner.
- 2026-02-21: Admin editor workflow upgrades: dirty-only filter, publish-all-dirty action, inline confirmation panel replacing repetitive `window.confirm`, and summary feedback for batch publish.
- 2026-02-21: Geolocation resilience pass: retain last known snapshot on GPS request failures and surface live GPS-fix age/stale status in quest UI.
- 2026-02-21: `npm run check` passes after changes (lint + typecheck + build).
- 2026-02-21: Re-attempted Playwright skill client validation in another local environment; still blocked by environment/runtime mismatch.
- 2026-02-21: Documentation cleanup: repository-level Playwright support is present (`playwright` in `package.json`, Chromium install in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); earlier "missing package" wording was stale.
- 2026-02-21: Added deterministic release QA artifacts (`docs/qa/release-checklist.md`, `docs/qa/release-gate.md`, `docs/supabase_route_profile_audit.sql`) and linked them from `README.md` + `docs/project-context.md`.
- Scope: docs QA/release process and route-profile SQL integrity checks.
- Why: make preview/staging go/no-go reproducible and remove ambiguity from release decisions.
- Validation: `npm run check` passed.
- Follow-up: execute SQL audits in staging and attach snapshots to release notes.
- 2026-02-21: Added CI hardening (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with required staging secrets validation, unit test run, Chromium install, and Playwright smoke gate against local preview.
- Scope: CI required checks and smoke automation scripts.
- Why: block regressions in QR/profile/session progression before merge.
- Validation: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build` passed locally.
- Follow-up: configure GitHub secrets (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) before enforcing required checks.
- 2026-02-21: Added targeted runtime unit tests for `GameSessionService`, `ResolveQrEntryRouteUseCase`, and `EnsureRunSessionUseCase`, including wrap-around progression and `entry=qr` restart behavior.
- Scope: `src/**/*.test.ts`, shared test fixtures, and vitest config.
- Why: protect critical route-generation invariants and QR-start restart logic.
- Validation: `npm run test:unit` passed (9 tests).
- Follow-up: local smoke (`npm run test:smoke`) requires runtime env (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
